## About The Project

The Colortastic Extravaganza is a simple browser-based game designed to test and improve your ability to recognize RGB color codes. Players are presented with multiple color squares and must guess the square that matches the displayed RGB code.   

This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, JavaScript event handling, and responsive web design. It includes:   

- Interactive UI with dynamic elements.    
- Game modes for varying difficulty.   
- Real-time feedback for correct and incorrect guesses. 

The accompanying CSS file ensures a visually appealing and responsive design across devices.    

## Getting Started  

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.    
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.   

### Running    

1. Open the index.html file in your browser to launch the game.   
2. Choose a difficulty mode:   
    - Easy Mode: Play with 3 squares.   
    - Hard Mode: Play with 6 squares.    
3. Click on a square to make your guess.   
4. Press the New Colors button to start a new round.

Game Modes:
- Easy Mode: Reduces the number of squares to 3, making it more accessible for beginners.
- Hard Mode: Offers the full set of 6 squares for a greater challenge.
Switch between modes by clicking the Easy or Hard buttons. The selected mode will reset the game with the appropriate number of squares.


## Evaluation

The Colortastic Extravaganza demonstrates a robust implementation of dynamic user interfaces and JavaScript event handling. Key features include dynamic color generation, responsive design, and seamless interaction between game elements.   

Strengths:   
- The encapsulation of game logic within functions promotes modularity and code readability.   
- The use of event listeners enables interactive and responsive gameplay.   
- The dynamic adjustment of difficulty levels ensures the game is suitable for players of varying skill levels.   
- The CSS styling enhances the visual appeal and usability of the game.

Testing:    
- Rigorous testing confirmed the accuracy of RGB color matching and functionality across difficulty modes.   
- The game's responsiveness was validated on multiple devices, including desktops and mobile browsers.   
- Edge cases, such as incorrect guesses and quick mode switching, were tested to ensure stability.   

Areas for Improvement:   
- The current implementation could benefit from a score tracking system to incentivize repeated play.   
- Adding error handling for unexpected user input or browser limitations could improve stability.   
- Enhanced visual feedback for incorrect guesses, such as animations or sound effects, could improve user engagement.   
<!--
Discuss the stability of your implementation. What works well? Are there any bugs? Is everything tested properly? Are there still features that have not been implemented? Also, if you had the time, what improvements would you make to your implementation? Are there things which you would have done completely differently? Try to aim for at least 250 words.
